## bio
Hello! I'm [Holly Zijderveld](https://hollyz1jderveld.github.io), and I'm an anthropologist enrolled in the [MSc program Global Ethnography](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/cultural-anthropology-and-development-sociology/global-ethnography) at [Leiden University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden_University) in the Netherlands. I am currently planning an ethnographic research project into the All Yarns are Beautiful (AYAB) project. You can see more about my specific research interests below! I am a [pretty experienced hand-knitter](https://www.ravelry.com/people/Midnight4225) who is getting started with machine knitting, and growingly interested in technology and its history.

## research interests
Cultural anthropological/ethnographic research looks at people and social life. One thing anthropologists look at is how people interact with the world around them, including other people, animals, and objects.  

My research looks into how people use AYAB and knitting machines, as well as the community around the AYAB project. I'm also really interested in the history of women in computing, for example!

I am really interested in how developers **and** users of AYAB interact with their knitting machines and the AYAB technology. If you're a **developer on the AYAB project** and/or you **use AYAB with your knitting machine**, I would love to speak with you about it! I'm interested in users/developers from all over the world, so don't let that stop you from reaching out!

## contact
If you are a user/developer of AYAB and you'd like to speak to me about my research, then please **email** me at h.zijderveld@umail.leidenuniv.nl. You could also message me on **discord** if you use it, my user is @midnight4225. 

If you have questions about me & want to check certain things about the project, you can email **my supervisor**, [Elsa Charlety](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/elsa-charlety#tab-1) from the Institute of Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology at Leiden University.

## current status of the project
~~initial planning~~ | ~~research proposal~~ | **fieldwork** | data processing | final writing | sharing

I am currently in the **fieldwork** phase of the research! This will extend until 31st March. I am looking to talk to users & developers of AYAB in this time. 

I will be in the San Francisco Bay Area in Feburary, and I will be in Berlin for some of March. If you are based in any of these areas and use/develop AYAB, then please let me know! If not, lets talk online.
