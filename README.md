# Anthropological project
## bio
Hello! I'm [Holly Zijderveld](https://hollyz1jderveld.gothub.io), and I'm an anthropologist enrolled in the [MSc program Global Ethnography](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/cultural-anthropology-and-development-sociology/global-ethnography) at [Leiden University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden_University) in the Netherlands. I am currently planning an ethnographic research project into the All Yarns are Beautiful (AYAB) project. You can see more about my specific research interests below! I am an [experienced hand-knitter](https://www.ravelry.com/people/Midnight4225) who is getting started with machine knitting, and growingly interested technology and the history of technology.

## research interests
I am really interested in how developers *and* users of AYAB interact with their knitting machines and the AYAB technology. If you're a **developer in AYAB** and/or you **use AYAB with your knitting machine**, I would love to speak with you about it! I'm interested in users/developers from all over the world!

## contact
If you are a user/developer of AYAB and you'd like to speak to me about my research, then please **email** me at h.zijderveld@umail.leidenuniv.nl. You could also message me on **discord** if you use it, my user is @midnight4225. 

If you have questions about me & want to check certain things about the project, you can email **my supervisor**, [Elsa Charl√®ty](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/elsa-charlety#tab-1) from the Institute of Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology at Leiden University.
